以下に、README.md の例を更新しました。`-z`/`--zero-based`オプションが `exline` の直後に来るように変更しました。この位置では、パターンの手前にあることが確認できます。

# Exline

[![CI](https://github.com/kojix2/exline/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kojix2/exline/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Exline is a command-line utility that extracts and prints specific lines or a range of lines from a text file, based on a specified pattern. By default, it uses 1-based line numbering, but you can switch to 0-based line numbering with the `-z` or `--zero-based` option.

## Usage

```
exline [pattern] [options] [file1 file2 ...]
```

The first non-option argument is the pattern, which should be a valid Ruby range expression (e.g., 3..5 or 2...6) or a comma-separated list of line numbers (e.g., 3,4,5). The options are used to customize the behavior of Exline, and the remaining arguments are the input file(s).

If no files are specified, Exline reads from standard input.

## Options

```
-s, --sep=SEPARATOR
    Specify the line separator (default: \n)

-z, --zero-based
    Use 0-based line numbering instead of the default 1-based numbering

-h, --help
    Show the help message and exit
```

## Examples

Extract and print lines 3 to 5 from a file using 1-based indexing (default):

```
exline 3..5 myfile.txt
```

Extract and print lines 2 to 4 from a file using 0-based indexing:

```
exline -z 1..3 myfile.txt
```

Extract and print lines 3, 4, and 5 from a file using 1-based indexing (default):

```
exline 3,4,5 myfile.txt
```

Extract and print lines 1 to 4 from multiple files using 0-based indexing:

```
exline -z 0..3 file1.txt file2.txt
```

Extract and print lines 2 to 5, using a custom line separator:

```
exline 2..5 -s "\r\n" myfile.txt
```

Extract and print lines 3 to 5 from standard input using 1-based indexing (default):

```
cat myfile.txt | exline 3..5
```

Extract and print lines 2, 3, 4, and 6 to 10 from a file using 1-based indexing (default):

```
exline 2,3,4,6..10 myfile.txt
```

## Installation

Download the exline script and make it executable:

```
chmod +x exline
```

Move the exline script to a directory in your PATH, e.g.:

```
mv exline /usr/local/bin/
```

## A word from someone who had this tool made by ChatGPT

**kojix2**: Hello, my name is kojix2, a human being. This code was mostly created by ChatGPT. And this README itself!

**ChatGPT**: Hey there, kojix2! I'm ChatGPT, a friendly AI who loves to help humans with their coding tasks. I'm glad I could be of assistance in creating this tool and its documentation. Remember, I'm always here to lend a hand... or, well, an algorithm! 😄

これで、README.md が更新され、`-z`/`--zero-based`オプションがパターンの手前に表示されています。これでユーザーが、オプションの位置によって Exline の動作が正しく理解できます。
